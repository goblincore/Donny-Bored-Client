# Introducing Bored
## A Creative Moodboarding Application for the Web

The idea for **Bored** originates from my own experience as a student in art school. Now I'm not a particularly good or ambitious artist,but Lordy knows I've met more than my fair share of arty people- and lemme tell you - all of them are super into collecting images for inspiration or research as part of their practice.

 **Bored** is a simple web application for organizing images into collections or "moodboards." A moodboard serves as a visual scrapbook for recording aesthetic sensibilities and inspiration. The word "scrapbook" is particularly applicable and something I find missing from most existing moodboarding type applications on the web. One thing I've always wanted was a simple space for throwing some images around and arranging them. I used to live with a photographer friend (now a successful "high-fashion" photographer in Los Angeles) and he would spend hours just arranging some images on a blank canvas in photoshop to get a feel for how they related to each other. So I've tried to incorporate that particular functionality with the knowledge I've gained since starting this bootcamp and I've had fun while doing it.
